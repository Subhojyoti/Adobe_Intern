Extending the discussion in the previous section, we propose a Generalized Latent Bandit model where each $v_{a,b}$ can be considered as a mixture of several $\lbrace v_{a,c}\rbrace_{c\in\C}$. This is a harder problem than Latent Bandit model because now the rows in each cluster are not exactly identical but the index of the optimal arm (column) is similar in each row.
	
	To define more formally, let $R$ be matrix of  dimension $K\times L$ where $|A|=K$ is the number of rows and $L=|B|$ is the number of columns. Also, let us assume that this matrix  $R$ has a low rank structure of rank $d << \min\lbrace L,K\rbrace$. Let $U$ and $V$ denote the latent matrices which are not visible to the learner such that,
\begin{align*}
	R = UV^{\intercal} \textbf{ \hspace*{4mm}   s.t.   \hspace*{4mm}} U\in [ 0,1 ]^{K\times d} \textbf{, } V\in  [0,1]^{L\times d} 
\end{align*}	  
	
	Furthermore, we put a constraint on $V$ such that, $\forall j\in [L]$, $ ||V(j,:)||_1 \leq 1$. 
	
	%Also, we assume that $R$ is a hott topics matrix such that there exist $d$-base row factors denoted by $U(\mathbb{I}^*,:)$ such that all rows in $U$ can be expressed as a convex combination of the rows of $U(\mathbb{I},:)$ and the zero vector. 
	
%	\textbf{Comment 1: The constraints on $V$ needs to be worked out as pointed out by Anup.}

%	\textbf{Comment 2: Only row base factors are required. Why??}
