\subsection{Noise-Free Setting}

In the noise-free setting, in addition to Assumption \ref{assm:1} and Assumption \ref{assm:1} we assume two further assumptions.

\begin{assumption}
\label{assm:round-robin}
We assume that nature is revealing the rows of $\bar{R}(i,:), \forall i\in [K]$  in a Round-Robin fashion.
\end{assumption}

\begin{assumption}
\label{assm:d-indep}
We assume that any $d$ sets of rows or columns are independent in $\bar{R}$.
\end{assumption}
