% This is the LaTeX template file for lecture notes for CS267,
% Applications of Parallel Computing.  When preparing 
% LaTeX notes for this class, please use this template.
%
% To familiarize yourself with this template, the body contains
% some examples of its use.  Look them over.  Then you can
% run LaTeX on this file.  After you have LaTeXed this file then
% you can look over the result either by printing it out with
% dvips or using xdvi.

\section{Summary Of Discussion}

	I have been doing literature survey on the area chosen: \textbf{Learning latent variable models through online learning}.

\section{Notations}
$T$ denotes the time horizon. $\mathcal{A}$ denotes the set of arms with individual arm is denoted by $i$ such that $i=1,\ldots, K$. The term $S_i$ and $F_i$ denotes the success and the failure respectively for the arm $i$ . The distribution associated with individual arm $i$ is denoted by $D_i$ whereas the reward drawn from that distribution for the $t$-th time instant is denoted by $x_{i,t}$. $r_i$ denotes the expected mean of the reward distribution $D_i$ and $\hat{r}_{i}(t)$ denotes the estimated mean for the arm $i$. All rewards are bounded in $[0,1]$. $n_i$ denotes the number of times arm $i$ has been pulled.

	We define each expert or forecaster as $f_{j}\in \mathcal{M}_t$, where $\mathcal{M}_t$ is the set of all forecasters at time $t$. $\mathcal{M^+}_t$ is the set of new forecasters introduced at time $t$. Also, we define $\hat{L}_{f_i,t}=\sum_{s=1}^{t}\ell_{f_i ,s}$ as the true cumulative loss suffered by the expert $f_i$ till $t$-th timestep and $\hat{L}_{f_i,t}$ as the estimated cumulative loss suffered by an expert $f_i$ till $t$-th timestep such that $\hat{L}_{f_i,t}=\sum_{s=1}^{t}\hat{\ell}_{f_i ,s}$. Similarly, we define $L_{i}$ and $\hat{L}_{i}$ as the true loss and the estimated loss suffered by arm $i$. The weight of an expert $f_i$ at time $t$ is defined as $w_{f_i,t}$ and $\eta$ is defined as a parameter for exploration. Also let $i_{f_j\in \mathcal{M},t}$ be the action suggested by expert $f_j$ at time $t$.
